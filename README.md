## Overview
This site provides Supplemental Material for the 
research paper "Signs of Scribal Intent in the Voynich Manuscript".


The paper presents the results of a QuantumLynx Research study series exploring
the cryptic Voynich Manuscript. This particular study is the first for which 
formal results have been compiled for presentation (hence its reference name of Z01).
The study looked for signs of scribal intent hidden in overlooked features of the 
“Voynichese” script. The findings indicate that distributions of tokens within paragraphs 
vary significantly based on positions defined not only by elements intrinsic to the 
script such as paragraph and line boundaries but also by extrinsic elements, 
namely the hand-drawn illustrations of plants.
